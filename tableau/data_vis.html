          Digital technology is often assumed to be universally accessible, 
          yet real-world data showcases that many websites unintentionally 
          exclude users with disabilities. Utilizing over 3,500 documented 
          accessibility violations across 448 websites spanning domains including 
          health, education, government, news, technology, and e-commerce, 
          our team analyzed where accessibility barriers occur, what forms 
          they take, and how severe their impact is. Our findings create clear 
          actionable insight to help organizations understand where technology 
          fails and how it can better serve everyone.

            Understanding how accessibility barriers differ across industries is 
            essential to identifying where digital exclusion is most prevalent. 
            Clear patterns of systemic inequity in web design are obvious when analyzing 
            the number of accessibility violations within each domain category including 
            health, education, government, and e-commerce.

            Not all industries will prioritize accessibility equally. 
            Certain domains consistently demonstrate higher concentrations of 
            violations, indicating structural design practices that unintentionally 
            exclude users with disabilities. These disparities showcase where accessibility 
            risks are most severe and where remediation efforts could produce the greatest 
            improvement in digital accessibility.

            The visualization provides a clear data-driven perspective on which sectors place 
            users most 
            at risk of exclusion and where targeted accessibility interventions would yield the 
            highest impact.

            Beyond identifying which industries experience the most violations, it is equally 
            important to understand the kinds of accessibility failures that occur frequently 
            and whether patterns emerge 
            across syntactic, semantic, and layout-related issues.
            By examining the most common violation types across domains, 
            we find that a small subset of recurring accessibility errors accounts for a 
            disproportionate share of total barriers. This concentration suggests that meaningful 
            improvements in accessibility 
            could be achieved by prioritizing fixes for only a handful of high-frequency issues, 
            including missing alternative text, 
            insufficient color contrast, or improper heading structures.
            Recognizing these recurring barriers transforms accessibility from an 
            abstract challenge into an actionable design strategy. Enabling organizations to focus 
            resources on the changes would most effectively expand inclusivity access across thousands of webpages.

            While frequency of violations is important, the severity of those 
            violations ultimately determines their real-world impact on users. 
            Some webpages may contain numerous minor issues, whereas others exhibit 
            moderate to serious accessibility failures that significantly affect navigation, 
            comprehension, or interaction for individuals with disabilities. 
            By identifying the pages and domains with the most severe accessibility issues, 
            patterns are uncovered in how different industries unintentionally exclude users. 
            These patterns reveal hidden design assumptions, including reliance on visually complex 
            layouts, insufficient semantic structure, or inaccessible interactive components that 
            contribute disproportionately to harmful user experiences.
            
            The analysis shows that many violations fall within moderate or serious severity 
            levels, confirming that accessibility challenges are not just technical mistakes but 
            barriers to equitable interaction. Moreover, a relatively small group of pages contributes
             heavily to overall accessibility harm, indicating that targeted remediation could substantially 
             reduce exclusion.

                Based on the analysis of the datasets, accessibility failures are
                systemic yet highly concentrated. This means meaningful improvements
                can be achieved through targeted, data-driven interventions rather
                than broad, unfocused changes.

                    <strong>Prioritize High-Impact Violation Types: </strong>
                    A few recurring WCAG violations, including missing alt text, 
                    poor color contrast, and improper semantic structure, cause 
                    most accessibility barriers, so fixing them quickly improves 
                    usability for screen reader, low-vision, and keyboard-only users.

                            Fix the most common and high-impact violation types first
                            to achieve the greatest improvement with limited resources.

                    <strong>Conduct Domain-Specific Accessibility Audits: </strong>
                    Organizations should perform industry-tailored accessibility 
                    audits, as sector-specific design practices and regulations 
                    require targeted reviews to achieve real reductions in exclusion 
                    rather than just surface-level compliance.

                Through targeted improvement, domain-specific insight, and systemic

                equity and inclusive user experience.
